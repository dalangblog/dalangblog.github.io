### Getting Started

**`Beginner's Guide`** ÔºöAnyone can successfully build their own blog according to this tutorial, even if they are new to Github.

- You can fork my blog directly, or download the code locally, modify it and upload it to Github

- Then change the operation in order to match the individuality of each person.

- The priority is to modify the _config.yml and CNAME files in the root directory.

```shell
# _config.yml
title: DA Lang						# Blog site title
SEOTitle: DA Lang | ÂçöÂÆ¢             # Title displayed on browser tab
header-img: img/post-home.jpg		# Images displayed on the home page of the blog
email: xxxxxx@gmail.com				# email
description: "Âí∏È±º‰∏ÄÊù°ÔºÅ" 			 # Home page description, can also be omitted

# Please refer to the detailed user manual for more details.
```

- Customize the domain name, if you do not have a domain name, please delete leave blank.

```shell
# CNAME
dalangblog.ga
```

- Finally write a test post Hello World!
- All posts are stored in the _post folder. So after writing your blog, please upload it to this folder.
- Create a new .txt suffix file and copy the following content, save it and exit.
- The file name format for blog posts is 'YYYY-MM-DD' + 'post name', so please rename the txt file to conform to the above rule.
- It is recommended to replace spaces in the file name with '-'
- Example: 2021-04-29-HelloWorld.md

```shell
# Test post: Copy the following content.
---
layout:     post
title:      Hello World ÔºÅ
subtitle:   ‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºå‰∏ñÁïå ÔºÅ
